## Dependencies
node.js (v20.17.0) likely the only thing necessary to download

## Run
1. Navigate to server folder. type 'npm run dev' and enter.
2. In a seperate terminal, navigate to client folder. Type 'npm start' and enter.
3. It will open the site on your browser and should have a URL similar to 'localhost:3000'

## Important Files
1. /client/Visuals.js is currently where frontend React JSX code is held and where it can be edited
2. /server/server.js has server information and will be how data gets transfered between frontend and backend through various operations. (Gonna need to figure out exactly how this works)
